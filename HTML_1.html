       		<div><p>Earth is the third planet from the sun in our solar system. The Earth is the only planet in our solar system not to be named after a Greek or Roman deity. Its name comes from the the old English and Germanic words meaning ‘the ground’.</p></div>

        	<div><p>Our amazing planet has been around for quite some time. By researching our planet’s rocks, scientists have calculated the Earth to be around 4.5 billion years old!</p></div>

        	<div><p>Like all the planets, Earth orbits (travels around) around the sun. And it does so at some serious speed –– around 30 kilometres per second, in fact! It takes 365 days (one year) for the Earth to complete one full orbit.</p></div>

        	<div><p> Have you ever wondered why we have different seasons? We’ll tell you –– it’s because the Earth is tilted 23.4 degrees on its ‘axis’, an imaginary line straight through the middle of the planet form the North Pole to the South Pole. This means that different parts of the globe are tilted towards the sun at different times of the year (or at different times during its orbit).</p></div>
